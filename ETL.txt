Here’s a step-by-step guide to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) using Power BI Desktop with the Northwind ODatafeed, and then create a visualization as required.

🌐 Scenario Overview:
You’ll:

Connect to Northwind OData feed

Clean and transform the data (ETL)

Combine tables

Add a custom field (line_total)

Visualize the results

✅ STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
🔹 Step 1: Extract – Connect to the Data Source
Open Power BI Desktop.

Click on Home > Get Data > OData Feed.

In the URL box, enter:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://services.odata.org/V3/Northwind/Northwind.svc/
Click OK.

⏳ Power BI will now load available tables like Products, Orders, Order_Details, etc.

🔹 Step 2: Select Tables
In the Navigator window, select:

Products

Order_Details

Orders

Click Load to bring the data into Power BI.

🔧 STEP 3: Transform (Power Query Editor)
Click Transform Data to open the Power Query Editor.

🧹 a. Remove unnecessary columns from Products
In the Products table:

Keep only these columns:

ProductID

ProductName

UnitsInStock

QuantityPerUnit

Select all other columns → Right-click → Remove Columns

🧾 b. Change Data Type of UnitsInStock
Still in Products table:

Click the icon next to UnitsInStock.

Choose Whole Number.

✅ Now you’ve cleaned the Products table.

🔗 c. Expand the Order_Details Table
Go to the Order_Details table.

You’ll see a column like Order (it has a small icon with arrows).

Click the expand icon (↕️) next to Order.

Select fields you want from Orders like:

OrderID

OrderDate

CustomerID

ShipCity

EmployeeID

Click OK to expand.

🎯 This step joins Order_Details and Orders into a single table.

➕ d. Add a Custom Column (line_total)
Still in Order_Details table:

Go to Add Column > Custom Column.

Name: line_total

Formula:

css
Copy
Edit
[UnitPrice] * [Quantity]
Click OK.

✅ This creates a new column representing the total value for each order line.

✅ Step 4: Load the Transformed Data
Click Close & Apply (top-left).

Data will load into Power BI’s data model.

📊 STEP 5: Create a Visualization
You can now create visuals using your transformed data:

🎯 Example: Total Sales by Product
Insert a Bar Chart.

From Order_Details table:

Drag ProductID or ProductName to Axis.

Drag line_total to Values.

✅ You’ll now see total sales (line_total) per product.

🎯 Optional Visuals:
Sales by City: Use ShipCity + line_total.

Sales over Time: Use OrderDate + line_total.
